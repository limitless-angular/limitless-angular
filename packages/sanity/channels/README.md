# ⚠️ Private Package Notice

This package is intended for internal use only. It is designed to be bundled into other packages, and it's not meant to be published to npm or be used directly.

## Origin

This package is derived from the [Sanity Visual Editing repository](https://github.com/sanity-io/visual-editing/tree/main/packages/channels). It provides access to the `ChannelsNode` type and `createChannelsNode` function.

## Future Plans

There is an open issue ([Visual Editing Issue #1755](https://github.com/sanity-io/visual-editing/issues/1755)) discussing the potential exposure of this package. This may change its status from private to public in the future, allowing for direct use and removing this internal package.
